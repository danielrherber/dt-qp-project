Mayer Objective Terms
============

Linear-Quadratic Mayer Terms
-------------------------------

Mayer terms are formed using the objective structure.
There can be an arbitrary :math:`n_M` individual structures that are then summed to construct the complete Mayer term:

.. math::

	M_k = \sum_{k=1}^{n_M} M_k

The properly-constructed structures then need to be assigned to ``setup.M``.

Nonlinear Mayer Terms
